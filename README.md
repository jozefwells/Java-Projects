# Projects

## Overview

The contents of this repo represent various projects I have worked on during my time studying Computer Science at Boise State University. Instructions for executing these programs as well as testing is presented in each projects README. This is not a representation of all projects I have completed, only a representation of some of the most challenging/complex of those completed.
